If you want to sort elements of arraylist in your own way, use comparator
--> Collections.sort(arraylist<T>, comparator<T>);


But comparator is an interface and we cannot create an object of interface.
Hence create a class that implements comparator and create object of that class.


		OR
		
		
Short Cut : 

	Directly write a method in comparator using lambda functions
	
	Collections.sort(arraylist, (s1, s2) - > {
		return s1.marks > s2.marks ? -1 : s1.marks < s2.marks ? 1 : 0;
	}
