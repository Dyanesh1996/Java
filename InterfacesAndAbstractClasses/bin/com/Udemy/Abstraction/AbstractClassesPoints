- Concept is very similar to Inheritance except the use of abstract keyword.(All possible common
 functionalities are written in one class and we create other classes which require specific methods
 and extend them to this abstract class.)

- Abstract classes serves the purpose of hiding implementation(similar to interfaces) 
  while Encapsulation hides information.


- 0 to 100% abstraction can be achieved using Abstract classes. While using interfaces, 
  100% abstraction can be achieved.

- We only declare methods in abstract class and implement them in some other class that
  extends to this abstract class.
  
- A class with at least one abstract method is an abstract class.

- We cannot create object of Abstract class/Interface

- 'extends' keyword is used.
