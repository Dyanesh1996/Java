Interfaces : 

- Interfaces serves the purpose of hiding implementation(Similar to Abstract classes) 
  while Encapsulation hides the information.
  
- 100% abstraction can be achieved using Interfaces. 

- We cannot create object of an Interface. Hence, we create new class that implements this interface.

- 'implements' keyword is used.


- We only declare the methods in interface and implement all of them in another class.
	e.g: Interface --> ITelephone --> has 4 declared methods

- Another class should implement to this interface and should have all the methods of Interface.
	e.g: Class DeskPhone implements ITelephone
	
So IN A NUTSHELL, we don't write any functionality to methods in interface, we just declare them
