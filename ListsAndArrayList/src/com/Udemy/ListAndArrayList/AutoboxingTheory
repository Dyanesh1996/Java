---------AUTOBOXING AND UNBOXING THEORY-----------


- conversion of classes and primitives into each other

- Arraylist expects classes as it's parameters and not primitive types.
	e.g. Arraylist cannot store integers in a straightforward manner like it does the String values.
	coz 'String' is a class and 'int' is primitive type
	
	
	
--------Autoboxing -------	

Converting primitive type into instance
	e.g.: 	Integer myInt = new Integer(30);
		--> Integer myInt = Integer.valueOf(30);	//compiler does this.
